In addition, the initiative will strengthen and secure the livelihoods of farmers through an agroforestry approach. We were delighted by Malvikaa's efforts and decided to support her plan for the three-year duration required for the completion of the project.</p></div></div><div class=row><div class="one column"><h4>2020</h4></div><div class="six columns"><h4><a href=https://cwsindia.org>Wild Shaale @ Centre for Wildlife Studies</a></h4><p class=text-small>Dr. Krithi Karanth of CWS has been at the forefront to address the human-animal conflict in and around wildlife habitat by relying on education, awareness, and rights-based approaches. We have contributed to CWS’ "Wild Shaale" program, a unique conservation-education program designed for rural school-going children living around wildlife reserves. Wild Shaale seeks to build foundational knowledge about local wildlife, ecosystems and conservation issues and in the process fosters tolerance for wildlife among children, who are our future stewards of conservation.</p></div></div><div class=row><div class="one column"><h4>2020</h4></div><div class="six columns"><h4><a href=https://securingwaterforfood.org/innovators/swar-centre-for-environment-concerns>Ecologically Sustainable Median Planting @ Center for Environment Concerns</a></h4><p class=text-small>Dr. K S Gopal is a pioneer who is driving an experiment for the ecologically sound planting of flora on a couple of kilometers of medians on main roads in Bengaluru. The aim is to support an ecosystem for birds and bees, use 50% less water, drastically bring down truck and road closure time, reduce costs for de-weeding, create biologically-rich healthy soils and reduce the probability of plant diseases. We hope this forms the template for urban arterial roads one day.</p></div></div><div class=row><div class="one column"><h4>2021</h4></div><div class="six columns"><h4><a href=https://vidhilegalpolicy.in>Vidhi - Center for Legal Policy</a></h4><p class=text-small>Vidhi Centre for Legal Policy (Vidhi) is an independent think tank doing legal research to make better laws and improve governance for the public good.

They work in a range of wildlife habitats—from coral reefs and tropical rainforests to the high mountains of the Himalayas. Their research also addresses human resource use and its impacts on wild species and ecosystems. Using this knowledge of wildlife ecology and human society, they design conservation strategies that are locally appropriate. These are implemented in collaboration with local communities who depend the most on natural resources, and the governments that manage them. While promoting wildlife conservation, their programmes also strive to safeguard livelihood and development options for local communities.</p></div></div><div class=row><div class="one column"><h4>2021</h4></div><div class="six columns"><h4><a href=https://reapbenefit.org>ReapBenefit</a></h4><p class=text-small>Reap Benefit is building a tribe of problem-solving citizens who drive change in their local communities by solving everyday issues using local data, local solutions and local campaigns.

The rainfed river originates in Chikkaballapur district and flows through three states--Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh and Tamil Nadu--before emptying into the Bay of Bengal. The restoration project will include multiple scientific interventions such as managed aquifer recharge, revival of the surrounding water bodies and network streams, planting trees on nearby barren lands and training and imparting knowledge to people in adjacent villages to conduct water audits for their respective water security plans.</p></div></div><div class=row><div class="one column"><h4>2021</h4></div><div class="six columns"><h4><a href=https://blog.rainmatter.org/the-power-of-messaging-as-a-climate-change-solution>Media Grantees</a></h4><p class=text-small>Successful ideas need to inhabit the mainstream conscious if they are to gain widespread acceptance.

CSEI’s Food Futures Initiative aims to boost water security and restore degraded land to improve 150,000 livelihoods in 2000 villages by 2030. Simplistic approaches to expanding water availability often miss the “zero-sum” nature of the game. As the focus has shifted from building structures to demand management and water budgeting, the initiative is co-creating digital and paper tools to help grassroots civil society organisations budget and plan for water better.</p></div></div></div><hr><h2 id=investments>Investments</h2><div class=project-list><div class=row><div class="one column"><h4>2020</h4></div><div class="six columns"><h4><a href=https://blueskyhq.in>Blue Sky Analytics</a></h4><p class=text-small>Good, reliable data forms the basis for bringing attention to problems and is key in finding the solutions to them.
