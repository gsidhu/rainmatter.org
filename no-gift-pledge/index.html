consider giving to a cause. Cut out the waste and pollution. Take the pledge.</h3><p>All across India, we love and celebrate our numerous festivals with great joy.
With festive seasons come gifting seasons.
Millions of gifts are sent not just by individuals, but also businesses.
However, corporate gift boxes sent in bulk by businesses to other business are unlike
individual acts of gifting that convey personal emotions and sentiment.</p><p>While our intentions are good,
we forget about the environmental impact of a gift box. For instance, a plastic laden gift box given in Bengaluru, is most likely manufactured in a far away place,
shipped by air to central logistics hubs like Delhi, Kolkata, or Mumbai, and then shipped back
to Bengaluru by road. Every step in the supply chain leaves leaves a carbon footprint
and generates massive amounts of waste.</p><p>We believe that businesses and corporations can convey their goodwill to each other
by supporting worthy social causes without generating material waste and pollution.
Businesses do not need gift boxes to brighten their day. Instead, they can celebrate the next
festive season by bringing the light to people and causes who really need it,
eliminating waste and pollution in the process.</p><p>Take the #NoCorporateGiftBox pledge.</p></section><br><section class=section id=orgs><h1>Causes</h1><p>Support any cause around you. If you are unsure where to start,
