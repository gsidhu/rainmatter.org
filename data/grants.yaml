The NGO’s sole mission and vision have been to intricately work on the restoration of fragmented corridors in South Bengal and recreate the rich biodiversity which was at one point a region dedicated to rich flora and fauna but with the advent of population explosion, it has got largely fragmented causing man-animal conflict and mass extinction of flora and fauna. This has also broken the connected ecosystem between Jharkhand, Orissa, and West Bengal. We also aim to work closely with local stakeholders to empower them and make them part of the whole rejuvenation.
