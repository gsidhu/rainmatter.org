We recognise that climate change is the biggest existential threat to life as we know it. We have committed to using the resources available to us to enable, and to attempt to replicate at scale, the potential solutions that may help address at least some of these threats, and aid in the restoration of our natural ecosystems.
We aim to support fellowships and organisations engaged in solving these problems, as well as startups working to help scale ideas in this space.</description></item><item><title>Contact</title><link>https://rainmatter.org/contact/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://rainmatter.org/contact/</guid><description>I can be reached at kailash@nadh.in</description></item><item><title>Funding</title><link>https://rainmatter.org/funding/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://rainmatter.org/funding/</guid><description>Our focus areas Rewilding - More Forest Everywhere — Your organisation works on or encourages direct rewilding of spaces, or encourages better soil management and biodiversity at farms, in public spaces and the commons in turn making every space a little more forest-like.
Resilient Ecosystems, Conservation and Restoration — Your organisation works to tackle air pollution, responsibly manages water resources, or is engaged in other similar domains.</description></item><item><title>Projects</title><link>https://rainmatter.org/projects/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://rainmatter.org/projects/</guid><description>Both re-wilding as well as the creation of a green economy need a deep understanding of ground realities and committed local changemakers to engage with local stakeholders. We provide direct funding and support to organisations listed here, and ensure that the solutions they drive are documented and made available to all: sharing evidence-based solutions is core to what we do.
If you are an organisation working in this area, you can apply for funding.</description></item><item><title>Research</title><link>https://rainmatter.org/research/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://rainmatter.org/research/</guid><description>I obtained a PhD (2009 - 2011) in Artificial Intelligence &amp;amp; Computational Linguistics from the Middlesex University, London, under Dr. Christian Huyck.
My thesis—“Modelling Emergent Phenomena in Associative Memory with Neural Cell Assemblies”—dealt (PDF) with the dynamics of associative memories modeled in in neural Cell Assemblies. The work involved creating Hebbian Cell Assembly models investigating natural language processing, simulated vision, spatial cognitive mapping, queriable hierarchical memories, self-learning agents, and more.</description></item></channel></rss>
