Both re-wilding as well as the creation of a green economy need a deep understanding of ground realities and committed local changemakers to engage with local stakeholders. We provide direct funding and support to organisations listed here, and ensure that the solutions they drive are documented and made available to all: sharing evidence-based solutions is core to what we do. 

If you are an organisation working in this area, you can apply for [funding](/funding).
