<h3 class="title">Zero Waste Offices</h3>

<div class="row">
    <div class="ten columns">
        The plastic cup nonchalantly tossed in the bin by the water filter has by now made its way to a landfill on the outskirts of the city.
        The confetti at the end of the celebration is flowing alongside our waters into the closest river.
        The tiniest particles of plastic are a part of our systems as much as the air we breathe.
        It is out of our sight in a second, but it impacts our lives forever.
        The amount of plastic that enters our oceans every year is over 15 million metric tons.
        The time for which most of these single-use plastic items are typically used is less than 15 minutes. Â <br/><br/>
        Once in a landfill or the environment, plastic never fully biodegrades. Fortunately, the plastic waste generated at events - from things such as cups, utensils, plates, water bottles - is avoidable.<br/><br/>
        Adopting a low-waste or zero-waste lifestyle is a matter of setting a culture as much as a pledge. It can take the shape of individual responses like encouraging employees to carry their own cutlery to a community response like segregating and recycling waste. As industry leaders you can help set the tone. Here are some resources to help you get started.<br/><br/>
