## Our focus areas

- **Rewilding - More Forest Everywhere** — Your organisation works on or encourages direct rewilding of spaces, or encourages better soil management and biodiversity at farms, in public spaces and the commons in turn making every space a little more forest-like.
  
- **Resilient Ecosystems, Conservation and Restoration** — Your organisation works to tackle air pollution, responsibly manages water resources, or is engaged in other similar domains.
  
- **Localized Production and Consumption** — Your organisation drives more local production and consumption, and boosts livelihood creation, especially outside tier-I cities.

At Rainmatter Foundation, we believe that these are important directions to pursue, and would like to enable and support such efforts.

## Organisational grants

At Rainmatter, we are focused on long-term outcomes that help create low footprint, sustainable ecosystems. Ideally, such outcomes will  strike a balance between environmental, economic and social indicators.. 
We believe that in the pursuit of these directions, organisations should have scope and flexibility to experiment with ideas, and while short-term projects are useful, they should not get in the way of the larger vision. We are eager to work with organisations that collaborate across the board and help adopt and adapt good ideas and best practices through cross-pollination. If you are one such organisation and relate to the focus areas listed above, please share your organisation’s charter and background, a summary of your efforts and the directions you are pursuing that need funding [here](mailto:info@rainmatter.org). We will get in touch.


## Small grants

Rainmatter Foundation’s small grants program funds organisations for a three-year period with annual grants. An organisation can apply for a small grant for a specific endeavor that falls within the ambit of the above-listed goals but sits outside the applying organisation’s charter. Examples of endeavours could be advocacy, education, creation of public platforms and tools within the above-defined focus areas. If you are one such organisation and relate to the focus areas listed above, please share your organisation’s charter and background, a summary of your efforts and the directions you are pursuing that need funding [here](mailto:info@rainmatter.org). We will get in touch.

## Fellowships

We offer three-year fellowships to candidates for chasing goals in the above-listed focus areas. We like ideas with a bias for action and real change on the ground, which can be documented   into playbooks for replication elsewhere. To apply, please share your resume, summary of your work and directions you are pursuing that need funding [here](mailto:info@rainmatter.org). We will be in touch.

Recipients of organisational and small grants programs as well as fellows will be required to send quarterly updates on the progress of their initiatives. An assessment of these updates will determine the release of grants for subsequent years. We will also include recipients on our internal and public forums to showcase their work, seek help and collaborations to grow their ideas and help others with theirs.


## Investments

We believe that businesses will have to recognise that taking climate action is an urgent and critical need, and that there is an opportunity for smart entrepreneurs to create businesses that are profitable and have positive impacts on the planet.

We invest in startups working in this area via our investment company, [Rainmatter Capital](https://rainmatter.com/). If you are a startup or an organisation working in this area looking for funding, please get in touch with us.
