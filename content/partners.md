Both re-wilding as well as the creation of a green economy need a deep understanding of ground realities and committed local changemakers to engage with local stakeholders. We forge partnerships and provide direct funding and support to organisations working at different areas of an entire spectrum.
If you are an organisation working in this space and would like to partner with us, please write to us at [info@rainmatter.org](mailto:info@rainmatter.org).

## Investments

While we have been primarily focusing on grants for non-profit organizations chasing impact in the climate space, we have also met several startups trying to ideate and build in this space. You can check out all of our investments [here](https://rainmatter.com/climate/).
